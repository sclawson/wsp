            	<h3>Site intent</h3>
            		<p>The website redesign objective of Spring Lake Elementary is 
            		to reorganize, condense the current 22 pages into 6 pages of 
            		more clear and focused content. This is also to help guide the 
            		user more efficiently around the site.</p> 
            		
            		<p>By minimizing the number of pages, we will focus more on the 
            		site being more informational, clean and less cluttered. Having 
            		the site more organized will help the targeted audience complete 
            		the goals of visiting the site often, keeping up with new 
            		information at the school and get more involved by accessing the 
            		volunteer email request form.</p>

            	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            		
            		<p>There are many other Elementary schools in the surrounding
            		areas of Spring Lake Elementary. When I looked it up on Alexa, I 
            		could only find the actual county schools web statistics. I am 
            		finding that with the theme of an elementary school, there's not
            		necessarily a lot of competition, seeing as how the students are
            		placed in schools demographically more than any other factor. So
            		with that, I think it is important to see how the other local 
            		schools in the area may be drawing more or less traffic to their
            		site and possibly look into the volume of volunteering.</p>

            	<h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
            		
            		<p>The targeted audience is definitely broad within the school
            		system. We have single moms and dads, blended families and in
            		some cases we have grandmas and grandpas running the roost. By
            		this information, it is important that we target a wide spectrum
            		of audiences.</p>
